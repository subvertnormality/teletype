## Queue

These operators manage a first in, first out, queue of values. The length of
the queue can be dynamically changed up to a maximum size of 64 elements.
A fixed length can be set with the `Q.N` operator, or the queue can grow and
shrink automatically by setting `Q.GRW 1`. The queue contents will be preserved
when the length is shortened.

Queues also offer operators that do math on the entire queue (the `Q.AVG` operator
is particularly useful for smoothing input values) or copy the queue to and from
a tracker pattern.

Most operators manipulates the elements up to (and including) length. Exceptions are `Q.I i x` and `Q.P2`.

Examples, only first 8 elements shown for clarity:
By default all elements of the queue have a value of `0` and the length is set to 1.
```
Q.N "length" ->|
element nb: 1  |  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
value       0  |  0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Using the Q OP will add values to the beginning of the queue and push the other elements to the right.
`Q 1`
```
1  |  0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Q 2 // add 2 to queue
Q 3 // add 3 to queue

3  |  2 1 0 0 0 0 0
```

Using the `Q` getter OP will return the last element in the queue, but not modify content or the state of the queue.

```
Q // will return 3

3  |  2 1 0 0 0 0 0
```

Using the `Q.N` OP will either return the position of the end marker (1-indexed) or move it:

```
Q.N 2 // increace the length to two by moving the end marker:

3 2  |  1 0 0 0 0 0

Q // get the value at the end, now `2`
```

By default grow is disabled, but it can be turned on with `Q.GRW 1`. With grow enabled, the queue will automatically expand when new elements are added with `Q x` and likewise shrink when reading with `Q`.

```
Q.GRW // enable grow
3 2  |  1 0 0 0 0 0
Q 4 // add to to queue
4 3 2  |  1 0 0 0 0
Q // read element from queue, will return 2
4 3  |  2 1 0 0 0 0
```
